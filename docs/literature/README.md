Place reference PDFs and notes here.

Suggested structure
- `refs.bib` — unified BibTeX file for the project.
- `papers/` — PDFs of referenced works.
- `notes/` — summary notes, annotations, or replication details.

Git tips
- Consider Git LFS for large PDFs if the repository grows.
- Prefer stable URLs or DOIs in `refs.bib` to reduce binary bloat.
